# Contributing

### Filing a bug

**For bugs** be sure to search existing issues first. Include steps to consistently reproduce the
problem, actual vs. expected results, and your OS and Brackets version number.
Disable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug.

### Submitting a pull request

**Before you start coding**, post to the [Slack Group](#) about what
you're thinking of working on, so you can get early feedback. We don't want you to do tons of work
and then have to rewrite half of it!

## Where Do I Start?


Some issues are marked with the 'beginner' tag, meaning that they are low hanging fruits for new contributors


## Contributing Code

High quality code and a top-notch user experience are very important to us, and we carefully
review pull requests to keep it that way.

The best thing you can do to get pull requests approved, is to make sure you communicate your intentions.


## The Code Review Process

We have assigned committers to each projects, which will be responsible for reviewing all pull requests, providing feedback, and
ultimately merging good code into `master`. The review process ensures all code is high quality,
maintainable, and well documented.

Once you've opened a pull request, a committer will generally respond to it within a week with an
initial set of comments (you don't need to ping anyone to find a reviewer). Some pull requests
raise larger questions about UI design, product scope or architecture.

Once your pull request is merged, it will appear in the next release.

Even if you're not a committer, you're still welcome to give feedback on any pull request!
