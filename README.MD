# Project Name

### Description / Rationale
Explain what this project does. Try to share why had Midburn created this project, what drives you to spend your time on it and how you think it will help others.

### Usage
Describe how people can use what you have created. A video or an animated GIF is always nice to be able to see it in action. You can use Asciiname or tty2gif to generate an animation from your terminal interaction. If your project is a library it’s good to provide some example code that shows the users how to get started and what behavior to expect.

### Badges
Badges are just dynamically generated images and they are a quick, visual way to show the status of various aspects of your project. They are somewhat optional though. Some of the most common badges are the ones for TravisCI (a continuous integration service) build status and the project’s version number. For a list of available and existing badges check out shields.io.

### How to contribute
We really want to get as many talented people working on this as possible. We must have a clear method to prevent us from stepping on each other's toes. Please refer to our [contributor's guide](/contribution.md)
